## Project Brisket

This project is meant to give the Guilty Gear Strive community a way of visually seeing the moves of Bridget

Current plan is to only display moves for Bridget. If the reception is great for this, I will consider adding more characters, but this is more for me (a Bridget main)

If anyone wants to take this code and apply it for other characters that's cool too! Just make sure to credit me in there!

You can follow the progress of the project on my blog *coming soon*
